Implemented three algorithms which converts an arbitrary tree to complete BST by reducing number of rotations in O(n) time and O(1) space making 
at most 2n â€“ 2logn rotations and improving on known previous results. Then the algorithms are improved with certain techniques given in the paper 
and obtained tighter lower and upper bounds.
